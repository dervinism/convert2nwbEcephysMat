# convert2nwbEcephysMat
Matlab functions to convert extracellular electrophysiology recordings and associated behavioural data to Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) file format. These functions work with both Neuropixels and Neuronexus data.

In order to execute the Matlab code, you will also need to download the [matnwb repository](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/matnwb) and add it to your Matlab path.

To get the code with the accompanying example data and test it, download [GIN](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki) repositories [convert2nwbEcephysMatNnx](https://gin.g-node.org/dervinism/convert2nwbEcephysMatNnx) and [convert2nwbEcephysMatNpx](https://gin.g-node.org/dervinism/convert2nwbEcephysMatNpx) for Neuronexus and Neuropixels data, respectively. Follow individual repository instructions on how to get and run the files.
